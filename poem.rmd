## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->

A boat beneath a sunny sky,  
Lingering onward dreamily  
In an evening of July —  

Children three that nestle near,  
Eager eye and willing ear,  


## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->

I have been one acquainted with the night.   
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain.  
I have outwalked the furthest city light.  

I have looked down the saddest city lane.  
I have passed by the watchman on his beat  

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->

The sun was shining on the sea,  
Shining with all his might:  
He did his very best to make  
The billows smooth and bright--  
And this was odd, because it was  
The middle of the night.  

The moon was shining sulkily,  
Because she thought the sun  
Had got no business to be there  
After the day was done--  
"It's very rude of him," she said,  
"To come and spoil the fun!"  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->

The rose is a rose,  
And was always a rose.  
But the theory now goes  
That the apple’s a rose,  
And the pear is, and so’s  
The plum, I suppose.  
The dear only knows  
What will next prove a rose.  
You, of course, are a rose –  
But were always a rose.
